A password manager working with Java, JDBC and MySQL.

A project for my OOP class.

Inlcuding Hash SHA-256 for master password storing and an AES algorithm for regular password storing.

All MySQL code was transformed into procedures and functions on the phpMyAdmin server.

All encryptions are done locally and then stored in the database.

The AES key is pulled from a website but has a backup key in case it can't reach the website.
